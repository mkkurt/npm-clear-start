# npm-clear-start

This extension is for developers who use npm start and clear commands in their terminal. It allows you to run both commands with one click of a button.

## Features

This extension adds a button to the status bar that will run the npm start and clear commands in the terminal.

One button runs only the npm start command, the other button clears the terminal and then runs the npm start command.
